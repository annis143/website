      <h1>Sunset </h1>
      <p>Bali is one of the nicest palces to look at sunsets. The beach of Seminyak is perfect. Alog the beach are many smal cafes who have seats on the beach. Every night is like a little party. Poeple go to the beach with their kids, have drinks and dinner. </p>

      <h1>The Ricefields </h1>
      <p>A must see when you go to Bali are the ricefields. We went there by scooter, you can rent them on every coner. For sure its really turistic and it is not for free. Each person has to pay 0,50cents per section. But it is so much fun to walk arounf the rice. </p>

      <h1>Gili islands</h1>
      <p>The Gili islands are three small islands close to Bali. We went to the biggest island Gili Trawangan. We stayed there a couple of days and had the best time of our lifes. When people talk about Bali being a paradise they are right! </p>
